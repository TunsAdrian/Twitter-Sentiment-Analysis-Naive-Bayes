# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Naïve Bayes

This is a project made for "Big Data Applications" subject, Master's degree. In the application, a comparison of Naïve Bayes classifier was made between a sequential algorithm
implementation and a distributed algorithm implementation, with the purpose of performing
sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset. 

A presentation of the general functionality of the application can be checked [here](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/BD-Project-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/documentation/Presentation.pdf), and a comprehensive documentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/BD-Project-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/documentation/Documentation.pdf).
